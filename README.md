Location-Logger
===============

understand the accuracy of network based geolocation

The app allows the user to log locations using the network provider.  Additionally, accuracy and UTC time is logged with each location.  The logging is dynamic where each entry (lat, lon, accuracy, time) updates according the minTime, and minDistance set by the user on the UI.  This can be modified to log other types of data, i.e., sensor data.
